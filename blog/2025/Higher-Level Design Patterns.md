## Computation-data duality

Code (machine code, bytecode, programming language code, etc.) can represent computation. Code already is data.

The idea is to use data to represent computation (includes logic and strategy). 

- Higher-order functions. A function value is a piece of code with data that can be called.
- Control-flow-state-machine duality. A suspendable control flow (async, generator) can be turned into a state machine. (Restate does serialization of control flow)
- DSL.
